DESCRIPTION

	WWW::SMS - A Perl framework for sending SMS messages


PREREQUISITES

	WWW::SMS depends on nothing (except Telephone::Number,
	but that's included in this package).
	
	Anyway its submodules won't work without:
	
		- HTTP::Request::Common
		- HTTP::Cookies
		- LWP::UserAgent

	SFR.pm (French gateway submodule) also requires:

		- Date::Manip


BUILDING/INSTALLING

	Once the archive is unpacked, use these commands:
	
		% perl Makefile.PL
		% make
		% make install
