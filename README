DESCRIPTION

  WWW::SMS - sends SMS using service provided by free websites


PREREQUISITES

  WWW::SMS depends on nothing (except Telephone::Number,
  but that's included in this package).
  Anyway its submodules won't work without
      - HTTP::Request::Common
      - HTTP::Cookies
      - LWP::UserAgent

  SFR.pm (French gateway submodule) also requires
      - Date::Manip

BUILDING/INSTALLING

  Once the archive is unpacked, use these commands:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make install
